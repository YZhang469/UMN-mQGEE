This repository contains R scripts which display functions and syntax that are used to carry out the simulation study and data analysis for the modified Q-learning with GEE (mQ-GEE) paper. The simulation results in the mQ-GEE paper can be reproduced by running the code in statistical software R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10). The application results only demonstrate how to apply our proposed method using a simulated data and should not be viewed as meaningful conclusions drawn from the M-bridge study. The following sections briefly explain how to use the files.

## Simulation study

### Custom functions

The document [functions.R](https://github.com/YZhang469/MQGEE/blob/master/functions.R) lists all the custom functions used in the simulation.

* The function `generateData.joint` generates a dataset, where the repeated-measures outcomes follow a multivariate normal distribution. This is equivalent to a conditional data generating mechanism with an unmeasured covariate.
* The function `Q` analyzes the dataset generated using composite Q-learning where the repeated-measures outcomes are collapsed with a weighted average. Users can choose between composite Q-learning (Q) and modified composite Q-learning (mQ). `Q` outputs a list of two models and two datasets: estimated models for stage 1 and stage 2 Q-functions using linear squares estimators, the original dataset, and the estimated dataset with optimal (counterfactual) outcomes based on parameter estimates from both Q-functions.
* The function `QGEE` analyzes the dataset generated using our proposed Q-learning with GEE, where the repeated-measures outcomes are treated as a vector. Likewise, users can choose between GEE Q-learning (Q-GEE) and modified GEE Q-learning (mQ-GEE). The function utilizes the R package [geepack](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geepack/geepack.pdf) to perform estimation using GEE. Users have to specify the working correlations at both stage 1 and stage 2; the default is "unstructured" for stage 2 and "exchangeable" for stage 1. `QGEE` outputs a list of two models and two datasets: estimated stage 1 and stage 2 models using generalized estimating equations, the original dataset, and the estimated dataset with optimal (counterfactual) outcomes based on parameter estimated from both Q-functions.
* The function `metric` defines the metrics we use to compare the performance of different methods. It returns a list of four elements for an underlying dataset: `pci.s2`, a scalar value indicating the empirical probability of correctly identifying the stage 2 optimal rule; `pci.s1`, a scalar value indicating the empirical probablity of correctly identifying the stage 1 optimal rule; `rmse`, a vector of three elements, with each element being the root mean square error of the estimates of heterogeneous (individual/conditional) causal effect of at each time point; `bias.mat`, a 3\*7 matrix, where each column represents the bias of causal effect estimates at various time points based on each value of the baseline measurement Y<sub>0</sub> in {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}.

### Simulation code and results

The document [simulation_by_sample_size.R](https://github.com/YZhang469/UMN-mQGEE/blob/master/simulation_by_sample_size.R) shows the code for the simulation study in Section 4.1 of the manuscript.

* The function `simulation` runs *I* simulations, where *I* is the number of simulations and is user-specified, and generates a list of metrics associated with the simulated datasets.

* The rest of the script shows the code to perform the simulation under different scenarios discussed in the mQ-GEE paper, and summarize the results using tables and figures. Note that it usually takes from 30 minutes to 1 hour for 1000 simulations to run.

The document [simulation_by_marginal_trajectory.R](https://github.com/YZhang469/UMN-mQGEE/blob/master/simulation_by_marginal_trajectory.R) shows the code for the simulation study in Section 4.2 of the manuscript.

The documents [simulation_by_weights.R](https://github.com/YZhang469/UMN-mQGEE/blob/master/simulation_by_weights.R) and [simulation_relative_efficiency.R](https://github.com/YZhang469/UMN-mQGEE/blob/master/simulation_relative_efficiency.R) contain the code for the simulation studies in the mQ-GEE supplementary materials.

## Application

### Data

To illustrate the implementation of mQ-GEE, we analyze a dataset collected from the M-bridge study. While we are not able to provide the original dataset, we include a simulated dataset [simulated_data.csv](https://github.com/YZhang469/UMN-mQGEE/blob/master/simulated_data.csv) which has the same format as the M-bridge data.

### Analysis

The document [data_analysis.R](https://github.com/YZhang469/UMN-mQGEE/blob/master/data_analysis.R) shows the code to analyze the abovementioned dataset

* The function `analyzeData` analyzes the dataset using mQ-GEE. Users can specify whether they want to use Q-GEE or mQ-GEE. Since we have a considerably large set of covariates (with time-dependent coefficients) in the model at each stage, we perform variable selection using the function `gee_stepper`. Results are then summarized using relevant tables and figures.

* The R code for the additional results in the supplementary materials, where unequal weights of the longitudinal outcomes are considered, is also included in the document.
